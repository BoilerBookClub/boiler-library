# boiler-library

A website to host access to the [Boiler Book Club](https://boilerbookclub.com) library. Members are able to perform all of the actions that you can expect in a library, such as borrowing and returning books. Note that this is just a GUI to simplify use; all of the books are physically stored in the office and so you must be in person to make use of the website.

All developers and users are expcted to be members of the club. To join, follow directions on the main club website or discord. This project is led by Kai Tinkess, the Communication Officer of the club â€” contact me through email or discord for any questions.
